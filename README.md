## Technical Implementation: Agent Generation

### 1. Agent Architecture

The system uses a sophisticated agent-based architecture for policy compliance checking:

#### Base Agent Framework
- **BaseAgent** (abstract class): Foundation for all compliance agents
  - Integrates OpenAI API for LLM-powered reasoning
  - Defines standard interface with abstract `check()` method
  - Handles error responses and JSON formatting
  - Provides consistent structure for all agent types

#### Agent Factory Pattern
- **AgentFactory**: Intelligent agent creation based on policy requirements
  - **Domain Detection**: Automatically identifies domain (financial, ESG, regulatory, etc.) from 11 supported categories
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Determines analysis complexity (simple, quantitative, comparative, multi-step)
  - **Agent Selection**: Chooses between specialized agents, universal agents, or hybrid graph+LLM agents
  - **Keyword-Based Routing**: Uses domain-specific keywords for accurate agent assignment

### 2. Agent Types

#### Domain-Specific Policy Agents
1. **ThresholdAgent**: Numeric limit verification
   - Handles ratios, percentages, and numeric thresholds (e.g., LTV ‚â§ 80%, FICO ‚â• 620)
   - Supports minimum, maximum, exact, and range comparisons
   - Performs calculations with unit conversions

2. **CriteriaAgent**: Categorical requirement checking
   - Verifies yes/no conditions (e.g., 2 years employment history)
   - Validates documentation requirements
   - Handles exceptions and alternative evidence

3. **ScoreAgent**: Scoring model implementation
   - Calculates weighted scores based on multiple factors
   - Normalizes values across different scales
   - Provides detailed score breakdowns

4. **QualitativeAgent**: Subjective assessment handling
   - Performs judgment-based evaluations
   - Considers compensating factors
   - Flags items for human review

#### Universal Agent
- Adapts to any policy type across all domains
- Self-determines analysis approach based on requirement complexity
- Generates analysis steps dynamically for complex multi-step checks

#### Hybrid Agents
- Combines Neo4j graph database with LLM reasoning
- Retrieves structured requirements from knowledge graph
- Uses graph for authoritative rules, LLM for edge cases and interpretation
- Particularly effective for credit and financial domains

### 3. Agent Generation Process

#### Step 1: Policy Document Analysis
```python
# PolicyAgentExtractor extracts agents from policy documents
1. Smart Document Chunking:
   - Token-aware splitting (target: 400 tokens per chunk)
   - Preserves logical boundaries and context
   - Handles multi-section policy documents

2. LLM-Powered Extraction:
   - Analyzes each chunk to identify compliance requirements
   - Categorizes into appropriate agent types
   - Extracts structured metadata for each agent
```

#### Step 2: Agent Configuration
Each generated agent includes:
```json
{
    "agent_id": "unique_identifier",
    "agent_name": "descriptive_name",
    "description": "what needs to be checked",
    "requirement": "exact policy requirement text",
    "data_fields": ["required", "data", "fields"],
    "priority": "critical/high/medium/low",
    "applicable_products": ["relevant products"],
    "exceptions": ["documented exceptions"]
}
```

Additional type-specific fields:
- **Threshold**: `threshold_value`, `threshold_type`, `unit`, `calculation`
- **Criteria**: `criteria_type`, `expected_value`, `verification_method`
- **Score**: `scoring_factors`, `scoring_weights`, `score_range`
- **Qualitative**: `assessment_criteria`, `evaluation_guidelines`

#### Step 3: Agent Instantiation
```python
# AgentFactory creates appropriate agent instances
agent = AgentFactory.create_agent(
    agent_config=extracted_config,
    domain=detected_domain,
    complexity=assessed_complexity
)
```

### 4. Compliance Checking Workflow

1. **Parallel Processing**: Agents run concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor
2. **Data Extraction**: Each agent extracts required fields from documents
3. **Analysis Execution**: Agents perform their specific checks
4. **Result Aggregation**: Individual results combined into comprehensive assessment
5. **Decision Generation**: Overall compliance determination with reasoning

### 5. Key Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Centralized agent creation logic
- **Template Method**: Base class defines structure, subclasses implement specifics
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different analysis strategies based on complexity
- **Adapter Pattern**: Hybrid agents bridge graph database and LLM capabilities
- **Observer Pattern**: Progress tracking and result notification

### 6. Extensibility

The system is designed for easy extension:

```python
# Add new agent type
class CustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    def check(self, data, requirement):
        # Implement custom checking logic
        pass

# Register with factory
AgentFactory.register_agent_type('custom', CustomAgent)

# Add new domain
DOMAIN_KEYWORDS['new_domain'] = ['keyword1', 'keyword2']
```

### 7. Performance Optimizations

- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple agents run in parallel
- **Smart Chunking**: Optimal document splitting for LLM processing
- **Caching**: Results cached for repeated checks
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple documents processed efficiently
- **Resource Management**: Automatic scaling based on workload
